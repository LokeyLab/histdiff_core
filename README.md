# histdiff_core

This is the main histdiff core library. This is will be used as a submodule for other histdiff related projects. If you want to directly use HistDiff please use HistDiff_standalone

### Purpose

The main purpose of this is to create a common HistDiff package for other programs to use.
Additionally, I want to attempt to refactor HistDiff to have the lowest memory profile as
possible.
